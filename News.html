    <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-size: 20px;">On 18 June 2023, Titan, a submersible operated by OceanGate, an American tourism company, imploded during its descent in the North Atlantic Ocean, about 400 nautical miles (740 km) off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The submersible, carrying five people, was part of a tourist expedition to observe the wreck of the Titanic. Communication with Titan was lost 1 hour and 45 minutes into its dive to the wreck site. Authorities were alerted when it failed to resurface at the scheduled time later that day</p>
    <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-size: 20px;">After a search lasting nearly 80 hours, a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) deployed from Canada's Horizon Arctic vessel discovered a debris field containing parts of Titan, about 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the bow of the Titanic. The search area was informed by the U.S. Navy's sonar detection of an acoustic signature consistent with an implosion around the time communications with the submersible ceased, suggesting the pressure vessel had imploded while Titan was descending, resulting in the instantaneous death of all five occupants inside the submersible.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-size: 20px;">The search and rescue operation was conducted by an international team led by the United States Coast Guard, United States Navy, and Canadian Coast Guard. Support was provided by aircraft from the Royal Canadian Air Force and United States Air National Guard, a Royal Canadian Navy ship, as well as several commercial and research vessels and ROVs.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-size: 20px;">Concerns had been raised about the safety of the vessel. OceanGate executives did not seek certification for Titan, arguing that excessive safety protocols hindered innovation.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-size: 20px;">Speculations regarding the failure of the pressure vessel are ongoing as of June 24, and mainly center around inadequate design or material fatigue, but the exact cause of the implosion has not been declared by any officials or administration</p>
